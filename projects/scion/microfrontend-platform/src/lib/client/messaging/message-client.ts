/**
 * Message client for sending and receiving messages between microfrontends across origins.
 *
 * This client implements the topic-based pub/sub (publish/subscribe) messaging model, allowing for one message to be delivered to
 * multiple subscribers using topic addressing.
 *
 * The communication is built on top of the native `postMessage` mechanism. The host app acts as message broker.
 *
 * ### Topic Addressing
 * A publisher publishes a message to a topic, which then is transported to consumers subscribed to the topic. Topics are case-sensitive
 * and consist of one or more segments, each separated by a forward slash. When publishing a message to a topic, the topic must be exact,
 * thus not contain wildcards. Messages published to a topic are transported to all consumers subscribed to the topic. Consumers, on the
 * other hand, can subscribe to multiple topics simultaneously by using wildcard segments in the topic.
 *
 * ### Retained Message
 * You can mark a message as "retained" for helping newly subscribed clients to get the last message published to a topic immediately upon
 * subscription. The broker stores one retained message per topic, i.e., a later sent retained message will replace a previously sent retained
 * message. To delete a retained message, send a retained message without payload to the topic.
 *
 * ### Retained Request
 * Unlike retained messages, retained requests are not replaced by later retained requests/messages and remain in the broker until the requestor unsubscribes.
 *
 * ### Request-Response Messaging
 * Sometimes it is useful to initiate a request-response communication to wait for a response. Unlike with fire-and-forget messaging, a temporary
 * inbox is created for the sender to receive replies. If there is no consumer subscribed on the topic, the platform throws an error.
 *

   * Unlike `observe$`, messages are passed to a callback function rather than emitted from an Observable. Response(s) can be returned directly
   * from the callback. It supports error propagation and request termination. Using this method over `observe$` significantly reduces the code
   * required to respond to requests.
   *
   * For each message received, the specified callback function is called. When used in request-response communication,
   * the callback function can return the response either directly or in the form of a Promise or Observable. Returning a Promise
   * allows the response to be computed asynchronously, and an Observable allows to return one or more responses, e.g., for
   * streaming data.
   * If the callback function returns no value (void), returns `undefined`, or returns a Promise that resolves to `undefined`, communication is terminated
   * immediately without a response. If the callback returns an Observable, all its emissions are transported to the requestor and communication is not
   * terminated until the Observable completes. Termination of communication always completes the requestor's Observable.
   * If the callback throws an error, or the returned Promise or Observable errors, the error is
   * transported to the requestor, erroring the requestor's Observable.

   * @param  callback - Specifies the callback to be called for each message. When used in request-response communication,
   *         the callback function can return the response either directly or in the form of a Promise or Observable. If returning
   *         a response in fire-and-forget communication, it is ignored. Throwing an error in the callback does not unregister the callback.
   * @return Subscription to unregister the callback. Calling {@link rxjs!Subscription.unsubscribe Subscription.unsubscribe} will complete the Observable of all
