/**
 * An activator allows a micro application to initialize and connect to the platform upon host application's startup,
 * i.e., when the user loads the web application into the browser.
 *
 * In the broadest sense, an activator is a kind of microfrontend, i.e. an HTML page that runs in an iframe. In contrast
 * to regular microfrontends, however, at platform startup, the platform loads activator microfrontends into hidden iframes
 * for the entire platform lifecycle, thus, providing a stateful session to the micro application on the client-side.
 *
 * Some typical use cases for activators are receiving messages and intents, preloading data, or flexibly providing capabilities.
 *
 * A micro application registers an activator as public _activator_ capability in its manifest, as follows:
 *
 * ```json
 * "capabilities": [
 *   {
 *     "type": "activator",
 *     "private": false,
 *     "properties": {
 *       "path": "path/to/the/activator"
 *     }
 *   }
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * #### Activation Context
 * An activator's microfrontend runs inside an activation context. The context provides access
 * to the activator capability, allowing to read properties declared on the activator capability.
 *
 * You can obtain the activation context using the {@link ContextService} as following.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Looks up the activation context.
 * const ctx: ActivationContext = await Beans.get(ContextService).lookup(ACTIVATION_CONTEXT);
 * ```
 *
 * #### Multiple Activators
 * A micro application can register multiple activators. Note, that each activator boots the micro
 * application on its own and runs in a separate browsing context. The platform nominates one activator
 * of each micro application as its primary activator. The nomination has no relevance to the platform but
 * can help code decide whether or not to install singleton functionality.
 *
 * You can test if running in the primary activation context as following.
 * ```ts
 * // Looks up the activation context.
 * const ctx = await Beans.get(ContextService).lookup<ActivationContext>(ACTIVATION_CONTEXT);
 * // Checks if running in the context of the primary activator.
 * const isPrimary: boolean = ctx.primary;
 * ```
 *
 * #### Sharing State
 * Since an activator runs in a separate browsing context, microfrontends cannot directly access its state.
 * Instead, an activator could put data, for example, into session storage, so that microfrontends of its micro
 * application can access it. Alternatively, an activator could install a message listener, allowing microfrontends
 * to request data via client-side messaging.
 *
