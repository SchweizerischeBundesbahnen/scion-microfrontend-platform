== Compatibility and Deprecation Policy
We are aware that you need stability from the SCION Microfrontend Platform, primarily because microfrontends with potential different lifecycles are involved. Therefore, you can expect a decent release cycle of one or two major releases per year with strict https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] policy. Changes to the communication protocol between the host and micro applications are backward compatible in the same major release. This allows for the host and its clients to update independently.

Deprecation of APIs can occur in any release. Deprecated APIs are only removed in a major release.
