== Embedding Microfrontends

This chapter describes how you can embed microfrontends in the host application and a micro application.

With SCION Microfrontend Platform, you can integrate any web page as a microfrontend using an iframe. If the microfrontend wants to interact with other microfrontends, you need to register it as a micro application in the host application.

NOTE: The web page to embed must not have the HTTP header 'X-Frame-Options' set because the browser would prevent its integration otherwise.
