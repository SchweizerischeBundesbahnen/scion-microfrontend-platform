=== Concepts and Usage
Embedding web content using an iframe can quickly become a daunting task. For this reason, the SCION Microfrontend Platform provides a router outlet that solves many of the cumbersome quirks of iframes. The outlet is a web component that wraps an iframe. It can be used like a native HTML element. As its name suggests, the web content of the outlet is controlled by a router. The router is a platform service, allowing you to set the URL of an outlet from anywhere in the application, even across application boundaries. When adding the outlet to the DOM, the outlet displays the last URL routed for it, if any. When repeating routing for an outlet, its content is replaced.

The router outlet can be added to a HTML template as follows.

[source,html]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet]
----

To display web content in the outlet, set its URL using the outlet router.

[source,typescript]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=outlet-router]
----

NOTE: If no content is routed for display in the router outlet, the CSS class `sci-empty` is added to the outlet. An outlet does not display content if no navigation has taken place yet, or if the outlet content has been cleared.

'''

The host application typically adds one or more top-level outlets to its main application shell.

[.text-center]
image::top-level-router-outlets.svg[]

<1> _PRIMARY_ outlet to display the main content
<2> _ASIDE_ outlet to display context sensitive content

Outlets can be nested, allowing a microfrontend to embed another microfrontend. There is no limit to the number of nested outlets. However, be aware that nested content is loaded cascaded, that is, only loaded once its parent content finished loading.

The following figure shows a microfrontend that embeds another microfrontend.

TIP: If using the <<chapter:intention-api, Intention API>>, you do not need to know the URL of the microfrontend you want to embed. Simply issue an intent for showing the microfrontend, pass the outlet name along with the intent, and let the microfrontend embedding itself. See chapter <<chapter:intent-based-messaging:issuing-an-intent>> for an example.

[[chapter:router-outlet:outlet-size]]
[discrete]
=== Outlet size
The router outlet can adapt its size to the preferred size of its embedded content. The preferred size is set by the microfrontend embedded in the router outlet, which, therefore, requires the embedded microfrontend to be connected to the platform. For detailed instructions on how to register a micro application and connect to the plaform, refer to the chapter <<chapter:platform-configuration:configuring-micro-applications>>.

NOTE: The preferred size of an element is the minimum size that allows it to display normally. Setting a preferred size is useful if the outlet is displayed in a layout that aligns its items based on the items' content size.

**The following explanations and examples refer to the microfrontend embedded in the router outlet.**

Embedded content can report its preferred size using the `PreferredSizeService`, causing the outlet to change its size.

[source,typescript]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:preferred-size]
----

In addition to explicitly setting the preferred size, the platform provides a convenience API to bind a DOM element via `PreferredSizeService.fromDimension` to automatically report its content size as preferred size to the outlet.

[source,typescript]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:preferred-size-fromDimension]
----

_Prerequisites for the element used as outlet size provider:_

- The element to be observed via `PreferredSizeService.fromDimension` must behave as block-level box and not as inline-level box. So, if you want to observe an inline element, set its display type to either `block` or `inline-block`.
- If the element to be observed should not fill the remaining space and may change in size, we recommend taking it out of the document element flow, i.e., position it absolutely without defining a width and height. Otherwise, once the element has reported a preferred size, it could not shrink below that size.

[[chapter:router-outlet:scrollable-content]]
[discrete]
=== Scrollable Content
By default, page scrolling is enabled for the embedded content, displaying a scrollbar when it overflows. If disabled, overflowing content is clipped, unless the embedded content uses a viewport, or reports its preferred size to the outlet.

The below code snippet illustrates how to disable page scrolling for the embedded content.

[source,html]

include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:page-scrolling-disabled]

[[chapter:router-outlet:keystroke-bubbling]]
[discrete]
=== Keystroke Bubbling
The router outlet allows the registration of keystrokes, instructing embedded content at any nesting level to propagate corresponding keyboard events to this outlet.

The outlet dispatches keyboard events for registered keystrokes as synthetic keyboard events via its event dispatcher. They bubble up the DOM tree like regular events. Propagated events are of the original type, meaning that when the user presses a key on the keyboard, a `keydown` keyboard event is dispatched, or a `keyup` event when releasing a key, respectively.

A keystroke has the following syntax.
[.text-center]
image::keystroke-syntax.svg[]

A keystroke is a `string` that has several parts, each separated with a dot. The first part specifies the event type (`keydown` or `keyup`), followed by optional modifier part(s) (`alt`, `shift`, `control`, `meta`, or a combination thereof) and with the keyboard key as the last part. The key is a case-insensitive value of the `KeyboardEvent.key` property. Two keys are an exception to the value of the `KeyboardEvent.key` property: `dot` and `space`.

TIP: For a complete list of valid key values, see link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values[window=\"_blank\"].

You can register keystrokes on a `<sci-router-outlet>` as follows. Multiple keystrokes are separated with a comma.

[source,html]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:keystrokes-html-template]

Alternatively, you can register keystrokes on the DOM element as shown below.
[source,typescript]

include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:keystrokes-typescript]

[[chapter:router-outlet:router-outlet-events]]
[discrete]
=== Router Outlet Events
The router outlet emits the following events as custom DOM events. You can attach an event listener declaratively in the HTML template using the `onevent` handler syntax, or programmatically using the `addEventListener` method.

activate::
The `activate` custom DOM event is fired when a microfrontend is mounted. It contains the URL of the mounted microfrontend in its `details` property as `string` value. The microfrontend may not be fully loaded yet.

deactivate::
The `deactivate` custom DOM event is fired when a microfrontend is about to be unmounted. It contains the URL of the unmounted microfrontend in its `details` property as `string` value.

focuswithin::
The `focuswithin` custom DOM event is fired when the microfrontend loaded into the outlet, or any of its child microfrontends, has gained or lost focus. It contains the current focus-within state in its `details` property as a `boolean` value: `true` if focus was gained, or `false` if focus was lost.
+
The event does not bubble up through the DOM. After gaining focus, the event is not triggered again until the embedded content loses focus completely, i.e., when focus does not remain in the embedded content at any nesting level. This event behaves like the `:focus-within` CSS pseudo-class but operates across iframe boundaries. For example, it can be useful when implementing overlays that close upon focus loss.

NOTE: Note that SCION can only monitor the focus of microfrontends that are connected to the platform.

=== Examples for subscribing to router-outlet events

The following example attaches an event listener in the HTML template.
[source,html]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:listen-to-event-in-template]
----

For an Angular application, it would look as follows:
[source,html]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:listen-to-event-in-template-angular]
----

The example below adds an event listener programmatically.
[source,typescript]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:listen-to-event-programmatically]

[[chapter:router-outlet:outlet-context]]
[discrete]
=== Outlet Context
The router outlet allows associating contextual data, which then is available to embedded content at any nesting level. Data must be serializable with the structured clone algorithm. Embedded content can look up contextual data using the `ContextService`. Typically, contextual data is used to provide microfrontends with information about their embedding environment.

Each outlet spans a new context. A context is like a `Map` with key-value entries. Contexts form a hierarchical tree structure. When looking up a value and if the value is not found in the current context, the lookup is retried on the parent context, repeating until either a value is found, or the root of the context tree has been reached.

'''

Imagine a tab bar with tabs implemented as a microfrontend. As an example, a microfrontend should highlight its tab in the tab bar when its data changes. For each tab, you can define a random highlighting topic and put it to the context of the tab router outlet. The microfrontend can then send an event to that topic when its data changes.

[source,typescript]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:set-context-value]
----
<1> Generates some random UUID.
<2> Puts the UUID to the context.

Embedded microfrontend can then read the `highlighting-topic` from the current context and send an event to that topic when its data changes.

[source,typescript]
----
include::outlet.snippets.ts[tags=router-outlet:observe-context-value]
----
<1> Looks up the `highlighting-topic` from the current context.
<2> Sends an event to the `highlighting-topic` when its data changes.
