=== What is Topic-Based Messaging?
Topic-based messaging allows publishing a message to a topic, which then is transported to consumers subscribed to the topic. Topics are case-sensitive and consist of one or more segments, each separated by a forward slash. Consumers can subscribe to multiple topics simultaneously by using wildcard segments in the topic.

The platform provides the link:{typedoc-url}/classes/MessageClient.html[MessageClient, window=\"_blank\"] service for sending and receiving messages on a common topic. You can obtain this service from the platform's bean manager as follows: `Beans.get(MessageClient)`.


[[chapter:topic-based-messaging:publishing-a-message]]
[discrete]
=== Publishing a Message
When publishing a message, the message is transported to all consumers subscribed to the topic. The topic must be exact, thus not contain wildcards. Optionally, you can pass options to control how to publish the message or set message headers. Transfer data to be carried along with the message (i.e. the message body) can be any object which is serializable with the _Structured Clone Algorithm_.

The following code snippet shows how to publish a message to a topic destination.

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=publish]
----
<1> Specifies the topic where to publish the message to.
<2> Looks up the  `MessageClient` from the bean manager and publishes the message.

NOTE: The method to publish a message returns a Promise that resolves when dispatched the message, or that rejects if the message broker rejected the message.

[[chapter:topic-based-messaging:receiving-messages]]
[discrete]
=== Receiving Messages
A microfrontend can receive messages published to a topic as following.

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=subscribe]
----
<1> Specifies the topic which to observe.
<2> Prints the body of the received message to the console, which is `22°C` in this example.

[[chapter:topic-based-messaging:wildcard-subscription]]
[discrete]
=== Subscribing to Multiple Topics Simultaneously
A microfrontend can subscribe to multiple topics simultaneously by using wildcard segments in the topic. If a segment begins with a colon (`:`), then the segment acts as a placeholder for any segment value. Substituted segment values are then available via the `params` property of the received message.

For example, subscribing to the topic `myhome/:room/temperature` receives messages published to the topics `myhome/kitchen/temperature` and `myhome/livingroom/temperature`.

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=subscribe-with-wildcard-segments]
----
<1> Specifies the topic which to observe; the second segment `:room` is a wildcard segment that matches any value (colon syntax).
<2> Prints substituted segment values to the console: `{"room" => "livingroom"}` when receiving a message sent to the topic `myhome/livingroom/temperature`.

[[chapter:topic-based-messaging:publishing-a-retained-message]]
[discrete]
=== Publishing a Retained Message
The platform supports publishing a message as a _retained_ message. Retained messages help newly subscribed clients to get the last message published to a topic immediately upon subscription. The broker stores one retained message per topic, i.e., a later sent retained message will replace a previously sent retained message. To delete a retained message, send a retained message without payload to the topic. Deletion messages are not transported to subscribers.

The following example shows how to publish a message as a _retained_ message.

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=publish-retained-message]
----
<1> Sets the `retain` flag to `true`, instructing the message broker to store this message as a retained message.

[[chapter:topic-based-messaging:publishing-a-message-with-headers]]
[discrete]
=== Publishing a Message with Headers
The platform allows publishing a message with message headers, which the receiver then can read. A message header can contain any data that is serializable with the _Structured Clone Algorithm_.

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=publish-message-with-headers]
----
<1> Adds a custom message header.

'''

The recipient can then access the message headers via the `headers` property on the received message, as illustrated in the following example.

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=receive-message-with-headers]
----
<1> Prints received message headers to the console: `{"authorization" => "Bearer <token>"}`.

[NOTE]
====
The platform adds some platform-specific headers to each message, like the message id or the publishing timestamp. Platform headers start with the Theta (`ɵ`) symbol. Some platform headers are public API and available to the application via the enum `MessageHeaders`.
 +
----
{"ɵMESSAGE_ID" => "8e53d603-ff12-400b-9d6e-8f41fbbe5f2b"}
{"ɵTIMESTAMP" => 1584124022134}
{"ɵAPP_SYMBOLIC_NAME" => "app-1"}
{"ɵCLIENT_ID" => "c8ce089f-10d7-4c82-b91e-11a7f60c15d3"}

[[chapter:topic-based-messaging:request-response-message-exchange-pattern]]
[discrete]
=== Request-Response Message Exchange
The platform facilitates the _request-response_ message exchange pattern for synchronous communication.

The communication is initiated by the publisher by sending a request (instead of publishing a message). The recipient can then respond to the request. Just as in JMS (_Java Message Service_), the platform sets a `ReplyTo` message header on the message, which contains the topic of a temporary inbox where the replier can send replies to. The inbox is destroyed when the publisher (requestor) unsubscribes.

The following code snippet shows how to initiate a _request-response_ communication and receiving replies.
[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=send-request]
----
<1> Initiates a _request-response_ communication by invoking the `request$` method on the `MessageClient`.
<2> Prints the received replies to the console.

Similar to publishing a retained message, a request can also be marked as retained, instructing the broker to store it in the broker and deliver it to new subscribers, even if they subscribe after the request has been sent. Unlike retained messages, retained requests are not replaced by later retained requests or messages and remain in the broker until the requestor unsubscribes.

The following code snippet illustrates how to send a retained request.
[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=send-retained-request]
----
<1> The `retain` flag instructs the broker to retain this request until unsubscribed.

[NOTE]
====
In request-response communication, by default, the requestor’s Observable never completes. However, the replier can include the response status code in the reply’s headers, allowing to control the lifecycle of the requestor’s Observable. For example, the status code `250` `ResponseStatusCodes.TERMINAL` allows completing the requestor’s Observable after emitted the reply, or the status code `500` `ResponseStatusCodes.ERROR` to error the Observable. See the enum `ResponseStatusCodes` for available status codes.

If the replier does not complete the communication, the requestor can use the `take(1)` RxJS operator to unsubscribe upon the receipt of the first reply.

Note that the platform evaluates status codes only in request-response communication. They are ignored when observing topics or intents in pub/sub communication but can still be used; however, they must be handled by the application, e.g., by using the `throwOnErrorStatus` SCION RxJS operator.
====

'''

The following code snippet shows how requests are received and answered. You can reply to a request by sending one or more replies to the `replyTo` topic contained in the request's headers.

_As an illustration, in the following example, a temperature sensor is subscribed to for each request. When the sensor emits the temperature, the temperature is sent to the requester. The sensor Observable is a hot Observable, meaning it never completes, emitting the new temperature with every temperature change._

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=reply]
----
<1> Reads the `ReplyTo` topic from the request where to send replies to.
<2> Sends the temperature to the requestor.
<3> Stops replying when the requestor unsubscribes.
<4> Sets a message header to immediately complete the requestor's Observable after emitted the reply.

TIP: If streaming data like in the example above, the replier can use the RxJS `takeUntilUnsubscribe` operator of the platform to stop replying when the requestor unsubscribes.


[[chapter:topic-based-messaging:convenience-api-for-handling-messages]]
[discrete]
=== Convenience API for handling messages
The message client provides the `onMessage` method as a convenience to the `observe$` method. Unlike `observe$`, messages are passed to a callback function rather than emitted from an Observable. Response(s) can be returned directly from the callback. It supports error propagation and request termination. Using this method over `observe$` significantly reduces the code required to respond to requests.

[source,typescript]
----
include::topic-based-messaging.snippets.ts[tags=onMessage]
----

For each message received, the specified callback function is called. When used in request-response communication, the callback function can return the response either directly or in the form of a Promise or Observable. Returning a Promise allows the response to be computed asynchronously, and an Observable allows to return one or more responses, e.g., for streaming data. In either case, when the final response is produced, the handler terminates the communication, completing the requestor's Observable. If the callback throws an error, or the returned Promise or Observable errors, the error is transported to the requestor, erroring the requestor's Observable.
